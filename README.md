# Safe Link URL Extractor/Decoder

## Overview

The [Safe Link URL Extractor/Decoder](https://thebadcoder96.github.io/url-extractor/) is a simple yet powerful tool that helps you extract and decode URLs embedded within a query string, commonly found in tracking links or email links wrapped by services like Outlook Safelinks. This tool is designed to make it easy for you to find the actual link you're after, without the tracking parameters or wrappers.

> Please beware that safe links provide a layer of security from malicious links. Use this tool at your own risk and make sure that the link you want to extract is safe.

## Why did I build this?

I was not able to open any embedded links by Outlook Safelinks at my work and/or when I am using the internet in cafes. Being frustrated by manually extracting the link, I decided to develop this simple tool. 

## Features

- **Extracts URLs**: Quickly identify the original URL from a wrapped link.
- **Decodes URLs**: Converts encoded characters into readable format.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click functionality to copy the decoded URL.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive user interface.

## How to Use

1. Paste the encoded URL into the input box.
2. Click on "Decode" to extract and decode the URL.
3. The decoded URL will appear in a box below.
4. Click "Copy" to copy the decoded URL to your clipboard.
5. You can also click on the decoded URL to open it in a new tab! :)

## Deployment

This tool is also available online, hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access. Check it out [here](https://thebadcoder96.github.io/url-extractor/).

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Start decoding your URLs!
